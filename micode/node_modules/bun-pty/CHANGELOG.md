## [0.4.10] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- musl libc support for Alpine Linux and other musl-based distros (#40)
  - Ship pre-built musl variants (`librust_pty_musl.so` / `librust_pty_arm64_musl.so`) alongside existing glibc builds via `cargo-zigbuild` with `-C target-feature=-crt-static`
  - Detect musl at runtime via `/proc/self/maps` and load the appropriate `.so`
  - Add `build-musl-lib` + `test-musl` CI jobs that cross-compile on Ubuntu and run the resulting artifact in `alpine:3.23`
  - Fixes #39

## [0.4.9] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Don't treat transient PTY read/write errors (EINTR/EWOULDBLOCK) as EOF (#42)
  - Reader thread now retries transient read errors instead of treating them as EOF. Previously a single `EINTR` (e.g. from a delivered `SIGCHLD` in a signal-heavy host) or `EWOULDBLOCK` ended the reader, which flipped the PTY into an "exited" state — after which `bun_pty_write` silently dropped all input while the child was still alive (a "deaf" PTY)
  - Writer thread now retries transient write errors and drops only the current chunk on a fatal error, instead of permanently terminating and dropping all subsequent input
  - Fixes #41

## [0.4.8] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- Use TextDecoder streaming mode to handle UTF-8 across chunk boundaries (#33)
  - Enables TextDecoder's streaming mode to properly handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters split across read boundaries
  - Fixes garbled output when UTF-8 sequences are split between chunks

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-10

### Changed
- Use glibc 2.17 via cargo-zigbuild for Linux builds (#30)
  - Updated build process to use cargo-zigbuild targeting glibc 2.17
  - Improves compatibility with older Linux distributions
  - Ensures binaries work on systems with glibc 2.17 and newer

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
- Restore .d.ts type declarations for TypeScript compatibility (#28)
  - Added TypeScript declaration file generation to build process
  - Ensures proper type definitions are available for TypeScript users
  - Includes dist directory in published package for type declarations

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- Fixed build script to skip building when libraries already exist
  - Build script now checks for existing libraries before attempting to build
  - Prevents build failures in CI/CD when pre-built libraries are already present
  - Allows publish workflow to work without requiring Rust installation in publish job
  - Improves build performance by skipping unnecessary rebuilds

## [0.4.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- Enable bun compile support by shipping TypeScript source (#25)
  - Ship TypeScript source instead of bundled JS for static analysis
  - Add statically analyzable require() for native library embedding
  - Fix Windows library name (no 'lib' prefix)
  - Fix spaces in Windows exe path handling
  - Add Windows-specific tests
  - Add compile test script to verify bun build --compile works
  - Fixes: https://github.com/sursaone/bun-pty/issues/19

## [0.4.3] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Use ubuntu-22.04 for GLIBC 2.35 compatibility (#23)
  - Updated CI/CD pipeline to use ubuntu-22.04 to ensure GLIBC 2.35 compatibility
  - Ensures built binaries work on systems with GLIBC 2.35 and newer

## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Fixed argument parsing to properly preserve arguments with spaces and special characters (#15)
  - Arguments containing spaces, quotes, or special characters are now correctly quoted
  - Prevents arguments from being incorrectly split into multiple tokens
  - Uses POSIX-style single quotes compatible with shell_words::split
  - Thanks to @snomiao for the initial implementation
